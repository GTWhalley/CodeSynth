# CodeSynth
A small website that allows you to generate or parse snippets of code by using the ChatGPT API

Initial Upload: Adding the functional HTML, CSS, and JS but it does not connect to the GPT API yet. Need to create a server, still too advanced for me at this point. Utilized ChatGPT 4 to create the functionality with JS. I am understanding how it all works together much better now, and finding this method of learning quite effective.
